# **Mellow — Mental Wellness Companion Bot**

Mellow is a gentle, supportive Discord bot built around two simple ideas:  
**expressing what you feel** and **finding healthy ways to cope**.

This project is **actively being developed** and will continue to evolve for the foreseeable future.  
Features will expand, systems may change, and the overall structure is still in motion — but the core goal remains the same: create a safe, private space for self-reflection.

## 🌱 Current Features

### **📝 Private Journals**

## 🚧 Project Status  
Mellow is **not a finished bot**. It’s an ongoing project that will continue growing over time.

Right now, only Journals and Coping are implemented.  
More features will be added gradually as the project evolves.

If you're here early:
- Expect frequent updates  
- Expect refactoring  
- Expect new ideas to appear as the bot matures
